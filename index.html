                                        software development methodologies by enhancing communication with the
                                        stakeholders, and concentrating efforts on the application's behavior instead of
                                        implementation.

                                Behavior-Driven Design asks questions about the behavior of an application before and
                                during development so that the stakeholders are less likely miscommunication.
                                Requirements are written down continuously refined to ensure the resulting software
                                meets the stakeholder's desires.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The User Stories are used as requirements to describe how the application is
                                expected to be used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                User stories are a lightweight version of requirements and replace design documents in
                                plan-and-document methodologies. User stories also help the stakeholders to plan and
                                prioritize development.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Spot misunderstandings is easier by combining working closely with the stakeholders and
                                concentrating on the application's behavior rather than the implementation.

                                    The solution to calculate a team's productivity is to rate the stories in advance
                                    according to the difficulty, and then calculate the average of points per iteration
                                    in order to decide how many stories try to implement per iteration. This is called
                                    velocity.
                                </p>

                                    <li>1pts. For straightforward stories.</li>
                                    <li>2pts. For medium stories.</li>
                                    <li>3pts. For very complex stories.</li>
                                </ul>


                                <p>
                                    As long as the team rates the user stories consistently, it does not matter the
                                    iteration's punctuation.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The purpose of velocity is to provide the stakeholders an estimation of how long it
                                    will take to integrate the desired features.
                                </p>

                                    User stories should not be complex that there is no clear way to approach them. If
                                    so, you should go back and evaluate with stakeholders if user story refactor is
                                    needed.

                                        It should add business value to one or more stakeholders. To drill down to real
                                        business value, you can keep asking "Why". Take the example of adding a Facebook
                                        linking feature.
                                        <br>
                                        1. Why add the Facebook feature? As box office manager, I think more people will
                                        go
                                        with friends and enjoy the show more.
                                        <br>
                                        2. Why does it matter if they enjoy the show more? I think we will sell more
                                        tickets.
                                        <br>
                                        3. Why do you want to sell more tickets? Because then the theater makes more
                                        money.
                                        <br>
                                        4. Why does theater want to make more money? We want to make more money so that
                                        we don't go out of business.
                                        <br>
                                        5. Why does it matter that theater is in business next year? If not, I have no
                                        job.

                                        In agile software development, a timebox is a defined period of time during
                                        which a
                                        task must be accomplished. Timeboxes are commonly used to manage software
                                        development risk. Development teams are repeatedly tasked with producing a
                                        releasable improvement to software, timeboxed to a specific number of weeks.

                                        These 3x5 card mockups are meant to engage the stakeholders and encouraging
                                        trial and error by creating a simple interface to describe how the application
                                        will be structured like.

                                        Lo-Fi sketches show what the UI looks like at one instant in time. However, we
                                        need to also provide a clear way to understand the interaction between the user
                                        and the app. This is when storyboarding comes handy, as it shows how the
                                        sketches work together typically represented by a tree or graph.

                                        To make a story board, you must think about all the user interaction with a web
                                        app:
                                    </p>

                                Following the Agile Manifesto's emphasis on customer cooperation over contracts, an
                                Agile team's notion of "cost estimation" is therefore more about advising the client on
                                what team size can provide the maximum efficiency, following Brook's Law that there is a
                                point of diminishing returns on team size. The Agile team's goal in the scoping process
                                is to identify that point, then ramp the team up to that size over time. Agile companies
                                bid costs for time and materials based on short discussions with external customers.

Feature: User can add movie by searching for it in The Movie Database (TMDb)

    As a movie fan
    So that I can add new movies without manual tedium
    I want to add movies by looking up their details in TMDb

Background: Start from the Search form on the home page

    Given I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
    Then I should see "Search TMDb for a movie"

Scenario: Try to add nonexistent movie (sad path)

    When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Movie That Does Not Exist"

    And I should see "'Movie That Does Not Exist' was not found in TMDb."
