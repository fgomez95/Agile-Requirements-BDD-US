                                        The Agile approach to project management attacks most of the common issues among
                                        software development methodologies by enhacing communication with the
                                        stakeholders, and concentrating efforts on the application's behavior instead of
                                        implementation.

                                Behavior-Driven Design asks questions about the behavior of an application before and
                                during development so that the stakeholders are less likely to miscommunicate.
                                Requirements are written down continuously refined to ensure the resulting software
                                meets hte stakeholder's desires.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The agile version of requirements is user stories, which describe how the application is
                                expeted to be used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                User stories are a lightweight version of requirements and replace design documents in
                                plan-and-document methodologies. User stories also help the stakeholders to plan and
                                prioritize development.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Combined working closely with the stakeholders and concentrating on the the
                                application's behavior rather than the implementation, makes easier to spot
                                missunderstandings.

                                    The solution to calculate a team's productivity is to rate the stories in advance
                                    according to the difficulty, and then calculate the average of points per iteration
                                    in order to decide how many stories try to implement per iteration. This is called
                                    velocity.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As long as the team rates the user stories consistently, it does not matter the
                                    iteration's punctuation.

                                    The purpose of velicity is to provide the stakeholders an estimation of how long it

                                    User stories should not be complex that there is no clear way to approach them. If

                                    business value, you can keep asking "Why". take the example of adding a Facebook
                                    linking feature.
                                    <br>
                                    1. Why add the Facebook feature? As box office manager, I think more people will go
                                    with friends and enjoy the show more.
                                    <br>
                                    2. Why does it matter if they ejoy the show more? I think we will sell more tickets.
                                    <br>
                                    3. Why do you want to sell more tickets? Because then the theater makes more money.
                                    <br>
                                    4. Why does theater want to make more money? We want to make more money so that we
                                    don't go out of buiness.
                                    <br>
                                    5. Why does it matter that theater is in business next year? If not, I have no job.
